// ai-generated: the whole file (an end-to-end window over the JVB relay,
// olcrtc#15).
//
// The JVB relays an EndpointMessage from one endpoint to another without ever
// pushing back on the sender: it reads the sender's association as fast as
// frames arrive (its advertised window stays at 4.5 MB) and queues them for
// the receiver in its SCTP send buffer toward that receiver, about 2 MB
// (dcsctp's default). A message that does not fit is dropped. Measured on a
// live bridge: a receiver that stopped reading for 8 s lost 224 consecutive
// 12 KiB frames once ~2 MB were queued for it, while the sender's own backlog
// never rose above its high-water mark. A dropped message is a lost smux
// frame, and nothing above repairs one: the stream it belonged to ends short.
//
// Nothing above bounded that queue either. bridgeBacklogHighWater bounds what
// waits in the sender's own association, and smux's windows are per stream: a
// phone advertises 512 KiB a stream, so six downloads may have 3 MiB in
// flight, 4 MB of base64 at the JVB. When the receiver's leg slows (loss on
// its downlink, a retransmission timeout) the excess over 2 MB is dropped,
// frames of every stream at once. That is how six parallel pulls through a
// GitHub runner all ended short while one pull never did.
//
// So a sender bounds what it has handed the bridge for one destination and
// the destination has not yet taken off the relay: relayWindow bytes. It
// follows its frames with a mark that carries how many bytes it has sent to
// that destination, and the destination echoes the mark as soon as its
// receive loop reaches it. The channel is ordered end to end, so an echo
// means every frame before the mark has left the relay and been handed up;
// what is in flight is what was sent less the last mark echoed. The count is
// the sender's own, so a frame lost anyway cannot skew it: the next echo
// covers it.
//
// Marks and echoes travel under their own magic, which a build without the
// window drops unread. The window therefore only holds a sender back once an
// echo has come from that destination: an older peer is sent to as before.
//
// An echo moves a window only when it can answer one of that window's marks:
// it comes from the endpoint the window is kept for, under the epoch its
// frames go to, with a count past the last echo and within what was sent.
// Anyone in the room can learn both epochs, but not send under another
// endpoint's name: the JVB fills in the sender. Counts never start over: a
// window opened after a reset or a reap starts at the session's count, past
// every mark sent before, so a late echo of one is out of its range.
