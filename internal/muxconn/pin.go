// Per-peer key pinning for multi-key rooms.
//
// A server serving several keys cannot know which key a peer holds until the
// peer's first record arrives. A PinGroup carries the candidate ring and the
// pin decision, shared by every Conn that belongs to the same peer (data and
// control planes), so whichever conn sees the first record that authenticates
// pins the key for all of them.
//
// Writes must never guess: sealing an early server frame (smux keepalive,
// window update) under the wrong key would make the peer drop it silently
// and corrupt the smux byte stream. Conn.Write therefore blocks until the
// group is pinned (or the conn closes). Single-key paths use PrePinned
// groups whose pin exists from birth, which makes the wait free and keeps
// the single-key behaviour exact.
//
// ai-generated: per-peer key pin over a crypto.KeyRing.
